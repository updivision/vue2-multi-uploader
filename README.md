 setting a minimum required number of files to upload.

### About this fork by Chupzzz

Original component by *updivision* worked fine except of *successMessagePath/errorMessagePath* props and *upload-success* event - all of them wasn't working properly. So this fork has this issues fixed. Pull request to updivision has been sent.

Message props contributed by [Mushood](https://github.com/Mushood) via PR. Thank you!

Optional `maxItems` prop added to allow setting a maximum number of files allowed per upload.  
Default `maxItems` is set to 30.

Optional `method` prop allows PUT method to be used. Default method remains POST, if you want to use PUT just add `method="put"` to your template.

Optional `postMeta` prop added so you can include additional metadata that needs to be sent along. This prop can be in the form of a string, array or object and empty `postMeta` data is not sent. To pass a string use `:postMeta="'string'"`, to include an array you should use `:postMeta="['value']"` and for an object use `:postMeta="{name: 'value'}"`.

Set JSON success and error response messages to your custom JSON responses via props:

Example template to use:
``` html
<multiple-file-uploader postURL="http://.." successMessagePath="" errorMessagePath=""></multiple-file-uploader>
```
Minimum items to upload (optional)
You can modify the minimum number of files required for the upload to take place by changing the value of minItems prop. Default is set to 1.
Here is an example template for uploading a minimum of 5 items and a maximum of 10 items:
``` html
<multiple-file-uploader postURL="http://.." successMessagePath="" errorMessagePath="" :minItems="5" :maxItems="10"></multiple-file-uploader>
```
### Events
Fires `upload-success` or `upload-error` respectively. Success handler receives axios response object. Error handler receives axios error object.
```html
<multiple-file-uploader postURL="http://.." successMessagePath="" errorMessagePath="" @upload-success='success_handler'></multiple-file-uploader>
```
```javascript
	...
	success_handler: function(response){

	},
	...
```

### Dependencies
Axios, ES6-Promise

### CSS
CSS style is not scoped so it's easy for you to overwrite your own style.
Bootstrap CSS is used in demo but not required for the component.

Class dropAreaDragging is active for giving some user feedback.
Example:

```
.dropAreaDragging{
   background-color:#ccc;
}
```
